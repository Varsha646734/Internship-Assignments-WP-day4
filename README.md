# Responsive Web Design - Task 4

## Objective
Convert a desktop-only webpage into a mobile-friendly one using **CSS Media Queries**.

## What I Did
1. Created a webpage with:
   - Header
   - Navigation bar
   - Main content section
   - Sidebar
   - Footer
2. Applied **CSS Media Queries** to make it responsive:
   - At `max-width: 768px`:  
     - Navigation bar stacks vertically  
     - Content and sidebar stack vertically  
   - At `max-width: 480px`:  
     - Font sizes adjust for readability
3. Tested the responsiveness using Chrome DevTools (mobile view).

## Key Concepts Used
- Media Queries
- Responsive Web Design
- Flexible Layouts
- Viewport meta tag

## Tools
- HTML
- CSS
- VS Code
- Chrome DevTools

## Outcome
The webpage adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile), making it mobile-friendly.
